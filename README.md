# TeXifier
A Discord bot that typesets your TeX (LaTeX? I'm not sure).

## How to invite this bot
Click [this link](http://bit.ly/2zODVhE) to go to the invite menu. Then select the server you want to invite the bot to, and click "Authorize". You must be the owner of the server in order to invite this bot (or any other bot).

## Using the bot
The bot takes commands in two forms. To typeset one "bit" of LaTeX, use `latex <your code here>`. For example:

To parse more than one "bit" in one message, use the delimiters `latex$...$`, like so:
